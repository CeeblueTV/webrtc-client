## Code Formatting and Linting Process

In our development workflow, we prioritize code quality through the use of the highly opinionated code formatter, Prettier. We have automated the formatting and linting processes on every staged commit to ensure that our codebase adheres to consistent standards.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on our code formatting and linting practices.

## Issues

Use issues exclusively for bug reporting and proposing enhancements.

## Pull Requests

To contribute fork the project, then submit a Pull-Request with your changes, targeting the **dev** branch.

## Commit Formatting

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for continuous deployment, versioning, and changelog creation.

Once `npm install` is executed, git hooks aid in the committing process. Should the hooks not install automatically, run `npm rebuild husky`. Use `git commit` to commit your changes; [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) assists in crafting a structured commit message. To complete the commit, close the text editor that appears (typically with ctrl + x), and then `git push` as usual.
